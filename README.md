ðŸ§ ** **Overview****
This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for real-time facial emotion recognition. The goal is to train a model that can accurately detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions using a webcam or image input.

Emotions classified:

Angry

Disgust

Fear

Happy

Sad

Surprise

Neutral
